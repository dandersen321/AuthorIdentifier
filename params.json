{"name":"Author Identifier","tagline":"Apply Artificial Intelligence to Stylometry to determine authorship of documents whose author is unknown or in question.","body":"Description:\r\n\tThe Author Identifier is a document tool that uses decision trees to learn the style of different authors.  It can then use what it has learned to make educated guesses about the authorship of document whose author is unknown (or in question).  This tool has been written in python using nltk and sklearn packages for parsing and AI learning respectively.  The dataset is currently about 7,500 books from the Gutenberg project (https://www.gutenberg.org/) but future releases may incorporate other media such as journals and emails.\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\n\tThere are several uses that one can find for the author identifier, but I will list the main ones I see: \r\n1.)\tPlagiarism: the tool could determine the probability that a paper under one author is actually written from another source\r\n2.)\tValidity of works:  the tool could determine the legitimacy of works whose authorship is in question.\r\n3.)\tDiscovering authors hidden under pennames: this tool could be used to help determine the author of books that have been written under a penname\r\n4.)\tSimilar writing styles: the tool could help determine how close different authorâ€™s writing styles are\r\n\r\nSome of the findings I have encountered while researching:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/WeedingFeatures.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/SingleParam.png)\r\n\r\n[decision tree pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/decisionTree.pdf)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
