{"name":"Author Identifier","tagline":"Apply Artificial Intelligence to Stylometry to identify authorship of documents.","body":"## Executive Summary\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to determine the author of a document from the text alone.  This problem may arise when checking for plagiarism or old documents whose authorship is in question.  To solve such a problem, this tool uses a decision tree to learn the style of many authors.  Then using this information it can analyze a document and determine with relatively high accuracy the original author of the work in question.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFor humans, it is difficult to analyze a document and recognize from the writing the author.  This linguistic practice is known as Stylometry and has many useful applications.  There are many ways this problem has been approached, but each typically consists of looking for similar patterns between an author's known works and the document being analyzed.  This tool attempts to improve the accuracy of such a method by using a decision tree that can find complex patterns that might be undetected by traditional methods.\r\n\r\nThis implementation was used on a dataset of 24,428 books from the Gutenberg project (https://www.gutenberg.org/) but future releases may incorporate other media such as journals and emails.  The tool will analyze each book to discover an author's style.  If successful, it can then use this information to predict the author of future books it has not seen before.  This tool has been written in python using the NLTK and sklearn packages for language analysis and AI learning respectively.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nThere are several uses for the author identifier: \r\n\r\n1. Plagiarism: the tool could determine the probability that a paper under one author is actually written from another source\r\n2. Validity of works:  the tool could determine the legitimacy of works whose authorship is in question.\r\n3. Discovering authors hidden under pen names: this tool could be used to help determine the author of books that have been written under a pen name\r\n4. Similar writing styles: the tool could help determine how close different author’s writing styles are\r\n\r\n## The Process\r\n\r\n### The Analysis Phase\r\n\r\nFrom my initial research [1,2], I used 31 features in my analysis phase.  They are:\r\n* apostrophesPerWord: how many apostrophes are used in each word\r\n* averageParagraphLength: the average number of sentences in each paragraph\r\n* averageWordLength: the average character length of each word\r\n* averageWordsPerSentence: the average words in each sentence\r\n* bigraphs: how often the two character sequence appears in a word\r\n    + bigraph-co\r\n    + bigraph-lc\r\n    + bigraph-me\r\n    + bigraph-we\r\n* digitFraction: how many characters are digits\r\n* numberOfWords: how many words the document contains\r\n* uppercaseFraction: how many words start with an uppercase character\r\n* whitespaceFraction: the ratio of the whitespace to words \r\n* WPT: (Words Per Thousand) how often a word occurs out of every thousand words\r\n    + WPT-and\r\n    + WPT-because\r\n    + WPT-but\r\n    + WPT-colon\r\n    + WPT-comma\r\n    + WPT-doubleHyphen\r\n    + WPT-exclamationMark\r\n    + WPT-however\r\n    + WPT-hyphen\r\n    + WPT-if\r\n    + WPT-might\r\n    + WPT-more\r\n    + WPT-must\r\n    + WPT-quote\r\n    + WPT-semicolon\r\n    + WPT-since\r\n    + WPT-that\r\n    + WPT-this\r\n    + WPT-very\r\n\r\nI calculated these features on each document then saved the results in a json file.  Using this method, we don't have to analyze all the documents every time the program is run (an analysis on all 24,428 books takes about 8 hours).\r\n\r\n### Creating the decision tree\r\n\r\nTo analyze the data I used a decision tree using python library sklearn's implementation.  The decision tree starts with all the data and then begins to divide it into sections or leafs where each leaf contains only (or a large majority) of one author.  The following is a simple example using 3 authors {star, circle, and triangle} and  2 parameters: {averageParagraphLength and WPT-and}.  In this example, after our analysis of all the documents we end up with the following graph.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/decisionTreeBasicGraph.PNG)\r\n\r\nIn this graph, each shape represents one book by that author.  Using this data we would then create the following decision tree:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/decisionTreeBasicTree.PNG)\r\n\r\nUsing this tree we can take the features of any random book and identify the author.  The decision tree used for this project is more complicated and not as perfectly categorized as the simple example.  If you want to see the complexity of the tree you can get a look here: [decision tree pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/decisionTree.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nUsing this method I was able to predict the correct author with a relatively high degree of accuracy.  This accuracy was correlated with two factors: the number of authors used and the minimum number of books each author must have written to be included in the dataset.  Each analysis is the average of ten trials.  The following graphs show the results.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/authorsUsedOnAccuracy.PNG)\r\n\r\nWe can see that as the number of authors increase, the accuracy decreases until it steadies at around 45% accuracy.  So given a high school classroom size of 30 students we would expect a 75% accuracy in the prediction of anonymous documents and given a large college course of 250 students we would expect 45% accuracy.  From this we can conclude that given a small number of authors this tool can be used as evidence to support an author's claim on a document.  With larger author numbers, this tool could be used to point potential acts of plagiarism that could then be investigated.\r\n\r\nA second but less impactful variable was the number of books an author needed to write to be included in the dataset.  As we can see from the following graph, the more books we have to analyze from an author results in a small positive correlation to our accuracy.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/minBooks.png) \r\n\r\n## Features of Importance\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the results, I also explored which features improved the accuracy the most.  The first way was to use only that feature and see how well I could predict the accuracy.  This resulted in expectedly low accuracy, but shows which features are strong on their own.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/SingleParam.png)\r\n\r\nI then looked at how the features combined to affect accuracy.  I did this by starting with zero features, and then adding one random feature and computing it's accuracy in predicting authors.  This resulted in the following data.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/addingFeatures.PNG)\r\n\r\nThis is just one instance and different orderings produce slightly different results; however, the shape of the graph holds pretty consistently.  As we can see, the first features are the most significant but after several features have been added each additional ones have a smaller impact.  We also see that certain features that did not do well on the single parameter test also added little or even hurt the accuracy when combined with other features.\r\n\r\n##Demo\r\n\r\nYou can see a sample run of the Author Identifier in action [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dandersen321/AuthorIdentifier/master/demo.mp4)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n[1] R.
